# Forest Hill Flyers

This project aims to design a website for the Forest Hill Flyers, a local group of drone pilots who meet regularly to fly drones, share knowledge and network. The primary purpose of the site is to attract new drone pilots to the club, via a contact form, which will enable the club to connect with potential new members.

The site features three sections, informing people what the club is about, the benefits of joining the club and a contact form which provides contact details to the club so that they can provide further information and encourage new membership.

## Features 

The main part of the project is to design a simple, single page site, which allows users to quickly determine the aims of the club, the benefits of joining and to be able to easily submit their details to find out more information, get answers to any outstanding questions and arrange a time to meet the organisers and other members.

The site is designed with mobile phone users in mind and will, therefore, be designed to be viewed on mobile devices and then tailored to larger screen sizes.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar links to the three sections of the website, moving the user to the relevant sections of the page.
  - The navigation is designed to be sticky, so it remains visible once the page has scrolled down, allowing the user to easily navigate to other sections of the page without having to scroll back to the top.

- __The header image__

  - The header image includes an aerial drone photograph taken above Forest Hill, where the club is based.

- __About Section__

  - The about section allows the users to get an understanding of the origins of the club and a brief understanding of the aims of the club and what it has to offer. 
  - The section features an image illustrating drone flying.

- __Why Fly section__

  - This section provides more detail on what the club has to offer potential members.  The section is split into four headings, with a brief explanation, with a central illustrative image.

- __The Contact Us Section__

  - This section will allow the interested user to find out more information, by completing a simple contact form. The user will be asked to submit their full name, email address and contains a message section which allows the user to ask any questions or provide any information they wish to add.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Forest Hill Flyers. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and shows club activities in far greater detail.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
- active navbar links don't seem to work for single page websites without the use of javascript
- internal links on same page depend on there being enough content to be able to scroll fully down the page.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!

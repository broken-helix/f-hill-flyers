# **Forest Hill Flyers**
## **Site Overview**

Forest Hill Flyers is a local drone flying club in Forest Hill, a town and area in south-east London.  
They offer drone pilots places to fly, technical suport and advice and community events, such as social events and day trips out of London.  
Whilst open to all members, the club has a great deal to offer people who are relatively recent to the world of drones.  
The creators of the club have asked for a web site to spread the word about what they have to offer and allow prospective members to complete a form to make contact and get more information about the group and events.<br><br>

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**

* New owners of drones with no experience
* Drone pilots with some experience 
* Professional drone pilots looking to network with other pilots
​
### **User Stories:**

* As a user, I want to see the subject matter of the page.
* As a user, I want to navigate the page to find what I require quickly and easily.
* As a user, I want to learn more about the benefits of joining the club
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the club
​
### **Site Aims:**

​
### **Color Scheme:**

The color scheme was designed to incorporate blues (#00063D and #0A6ACB) and warm colors (#F26419 and #F6A02D).  
The colors were selected to associate with blue skies and sunsets, which are desirable for photography, with a complementary neutral background (#EBEBEB).  
Sections alternate between blue and orange, to assist in separating the different sections as the user scrolls down the page.
Colors were selected using the coolors color palette generator.  <br><br>

​
## **Typography**

* Throughout the page, there are two fonts used:
  * Poppins - For all headings. 
  * Quicksand - for all content text.
​
* Quicksand was chosen for its less formal sans serif style and incorporation of less formal 'rounded' letter 'a'.
* Poppins was selected as a complementary font for the titles, as Quicksand lacked the impact for headings when scaled up in size.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## **Current Features**

#### *Header Section:*

* The Header section contains the H1 page title and navigation links.
* The section is 'sticky', so remains in place at the top of the page when scrolling down or selecting the navigation links.
* A bold orange color (#F26419) was used for the background to provide a clear contrast with the rest of the page.

#### *Page Title:*

* The H1 page title contains the name of the clu for whom the website is built.
* On smaller screen sizes, the title is centered to provide a consistent centered view in keeping with the rest of the page on narrower screen sizes.
* On larger screen sizes, the title is positioned to the left hand side, to provide a clear break between the title text and the navigation links.
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*

* The user is given links to each section of the page in the header section, which scroll the page down to the relevant section for easy navigation.
* The navigation links, along with the header, have been made 'sticky' so that they are always visible on the page, allowing the user to link to other sections without having to scroll to the top.
* On smaller devices, the navigation links are centered and well-spaced across the page, with padding below the links, to facilitate their selection on a mobile phone.
* On larger screen sizes, the navigation links are positioned to the right and grouped together, to seperate them from the site title.

#### *Header Image*

* The header image, displayed below the header content, is an aerial photograph above Forest Hill, where the club is based.
* The image is responsive, growing in size as the viewport increases, whilst maintaining proportions.
​
#### *About Section:*

* The about section provides users with a brief overview of what the club is about.  
* The section is split into three parts, an introduction, a central image and a brief overview of activities the club offers.
* On smaller screen sizes, the parts are displayed in a row down the page.
* On larger screen sizes, the parts are displayed as columns across the page, with text either side of the central image.

#### *Why Fly Section:*

* This section provides users with more detailed examples of activities and opportunities the club offers.
* The section again features a central image, with left and right sub-headings split into two parts each.
* Each sub-heading has an icon which provides a visual cue to the user as the the subject of the sub-heading.
* On smaller screens, the parts are displayed in a row down the page.
* On larger screen sizes the parts are displayed in a column across the page, with two sub-headings either side of the central image.

#### *Contact Us Section*

* This section provides users with a method of making contact with the club, via a form.
* On smaller screen sizes, the form is styled to fit narrower viewports, with form labels and inputs stacked vertically.
* On larger screen sizes, the form is stretched across the page, with labels displayed horizontally, in line with inputs.
* Users are able to provide their name and contact email address and submit a message to ask questions or show their interest in the club.
* Upon submitting the completed form, users are taken to a thank you page which shows users that their form has been submitted.

![Thank You Page](/assets/images/thank-you-page.jpg)

#### *Footer Section*

* The footer section contains links to social media platforms where the club uploads images and video.
* The social media links allow users to see more detail about past events and provide further ways to connect with the group.
* The links are styled to display as icons and increase in size and the page size increases.
* The icons were sourced from FontAwesome.
​
## **Future-Enhancements**

* The club have expressed a desire to host a blog page in the future, which will discuss events, information about flying drones and legal considerations.
​
## **Testing Phase**

* Responsiveness - The page was tested for responsiveness on screen sizes throughout the development stages, using chrome dev tools, which allowed the page to be adjusted to display on small and large screen sizes.
​
* Functionality - The links in the navigation have been selected individually to ensure they connect to the correct sections.  The form has been submitted without each input being completed to ensure that error messages are displayed, including entering email addresses without the '@' symbol.  The form has been submitted with correct entries to ensure that the Thank You page is displayed after submission.  The link returning users to the main page has been selected to make sure it is functioning correctly.

* Validators

​
## **Bugs**
​
* Issue - When using the links to navigate the page, the top parts of sections were hidden by the sticky header.
* Cause - The sections were displayed at the top of the page and the sticky header remained in place.
* Resolution - Sections were given a class called scroll and styled in the css file to have a margin equal to or greater than the height of the header section.  
  
* Issue - All attempts to highlight the selected navigation link using html and css failed.
* Cause - Further investigation into possible solutions, using google search and searches in the slack channels indicated that this was extremely difficult on single page websites, without the use of javascript, which was not contained in the brief for the project.
* Resolution - The issue remained unresolved.  
  
* Issue - When displaying the events card horizontally on larger screen sizes, some card displayed with a different height to others, dependent on the text contained within.
* Cause - The events cards sizing was dependent on the text formatting within the card.
* Resolution - A css style of 'flex-grow: 1' was added to the cards so that they expanded vertically to take up the available space.

### **Honorable mentions**
​
* The input from my mentor, Richard Wells, was invaluable in providing support, directing me towards such technologies such as flexbox and showing me ways to check text contrast, use lighthouse and guiding me through the ReadMe file process.
​
### **Content:**

* Problems with sections displaying under the sticky header were resolved based on support offered on this stack overflow submission, whih gave clues about using a margin-top to position the content below the header - ![stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13036142/anchor-links-to-start-below-the-header-which-is-fixed-at-the-top/)
